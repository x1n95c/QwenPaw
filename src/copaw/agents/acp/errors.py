    When user approval is needed for a permission request, this exception
    is raised instead of blocking. The runtime stores the pending state and
    returns control to the caller, which presents options to the user via chat.

    The full flow:
    1. Permission request arrives from harness
    2. ACPPermissionAdapter raises this exception
    3. Runtime catches it, fills in request_id, stores SuspendedPermission
    4. service.run_turn() detects suspension, saves session, returns result
    5. spawn_agent formats a chat message with options for the user
    6. User replies, model calls spawn_agent with permission_decision
    7. service.resume_permission() sends result to harness and continues

    Attributes:
        request_id: JSON-RPC request ID to reply to (set by runtime).
        payload: The raw permission request payload.
        options: Available option dicts for the user to choose from.
        tool_name: The tool requesting permission.
        tool_kind: The kind of operation (write, execute, etc.).
        target: The target of the operation (path, command, etc.).
